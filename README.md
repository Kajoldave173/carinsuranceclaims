For this project, I worked with a dataset called car_insurance.csv, which contains customer information along with whether they made a claim during their policy period. The goal was to build a predictive model to determine whether a customer is likely to make a claim. Since the objective was to keep the solution simple and interpretable for practical deployment, I focused on identifying the single most important feature that produced the best performing model, as measured by accuracy.

I explored the dataset using the provided column descriptions, conducted feature evaluation, and compared model performance when trained with individual features. By doing so, I was able to highlight which feature offered the highest predictive power, making it the ideal starting point for a production-ready model.
